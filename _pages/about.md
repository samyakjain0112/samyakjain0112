Final Year Master's student at IIT (BHU) Varanasi

Hi! I am Samyak.  I am pursuing integrated Bachelor and Master of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varansi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). For the last few years I have been broadly working on Machine Learning with a particular focus on Adversarial Robustness along with Generalizable and Explainable Machine Learning.
\\
\\
I have been working at the [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) and have been involved in deep learning projects particularly related to adversarial robustness and understanding the loss landscape of neural networks from the perspective of sharper/wider minima and mode connectivity, which have been published at the following [venues](./publications).
\\
I have worked with the [Theoretical foundations in AI](https://www.in.tum.de/tfai) at the Technical University of Munich where I tried on understand the learning dynamics, loss landscape and critical point solutions of linear neural networks. 
\\
Currently, I am also working under Prof. [Rishabh Iyer](https://www.rishiyer.com/) at University of Texas, Dallas, where I am trying to analyze the generalization of subset selection methods by understanding their loss landscape properties.
\\
Besides this I actively participate in machine learning  and computer vision conferences and have served as a reviewer at multiple conferences and won outstanding reviewer awards at ICLR 2022 and CVPR 2022.

Here is the link to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RkR64-PW96fat5oKHoMsQAB4zjAVaAM/view?usp=sharing).
\\
\\
Broadly I am interested in research topics related to:
\\
**Trustworthy NLP:** Memorization in Large Language Models, AI Alignment
\\
**Robustness:** Adversarial Robustness, OOD Robustness
\\
**Explainability of ML:** Generalization, Mode Connectivity, Loss landscape sharpness, Learning dynamics, Domain Generalization, Science of Deep Learning
\\
**Role of Data in Learning:** Spurious Features and vulnerability to Data Poisoning Attacks
\\
**Generative models:** GANS, Diffusion models
